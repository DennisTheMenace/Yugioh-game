Deck.................................................. (40 to 60 cards)
Assemble your favorite cards into a Deck that follows these rules:
The Deck must be 40 to 60 cards.
You can only have up to 3 copies of the same card in your Deck,
Extra Deck and Side Deck combined.
Also, some cards are Forbidden, Limited or Semi-Limited in official
tournaments. (See page 42 for details.)
Try to keep your Deck close to the 40-card minimum. Having a Deck
with too many cards makes it hard to draw your best cards when you
need them. This Deck is called your Main Deck.
