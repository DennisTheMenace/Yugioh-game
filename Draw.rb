# Method used for drawing a card.

# INSTRUCTIONS:

# To draw a card use this command template - 'draw(player, output, card)'
# Replace player with 0 or 1 to determine which player is drawing. 0 = player 1 and 1 = player 2
# Replace outout with 'yes' or 'no' depending on if you want it to output the card that you drew
# Replace card with false if you want to draw a random card otherwise type the name of the card you want to draw in quote marks



$hand1 = [] # Sets hand to empty before game.
